This is an opengl 4.6 Linux port for Ballenger (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aviL3HX3UEc)

Original Source Code: https://www.dropbox.com/s/cp244x2540zr32d/Ballenger_Demo.zip?dl=0

I rewrote almost all the opengl calls and removed the glut calls. Most of the game logic remains untouched (such as the collision and physics code).

This is a demo for a single player skill game.

Goals:
- Collect the 5 keys one by one.
- Insert each one into their respective column to open the portal.
- Cross the portal.

Keys:
- Move:			W, A, S, D
- Jump: 		Spacebar
- Rotate Camera: 	Mouse
- Fist person view: 	num. 1
- Third person view: 	num. 3
- Exit: 		ESC

Noclip keys:
- Enable noclip mode: 	F10
- Fly up: 		left mouse button
- Fly down: 		right mouse button
